##Limitations and Future Improvements

- The application currently fetches only the top 5 attractions near the specified destination.

In the future, the number of attractions displayed could be made configurable or increased based on user preferences.

- The application relies on external APIs (Google Places, Flickr) for data retrieval. If there are issues with these APIs or the user's internet connection, it may impact the application's functionality.

- The application stores favorite destinations in the browser's localStorage, which has a limited storage capacity. In the future, a server-side storage solution could be implemented for improved scalability.

- The application could incorporate additional features such as user reviews and the ability to filter attractions based on specific criteria (e.g., distance from userâ€™s location, etc.).

- The application could provide options to sort attractions by popularity, distance, or other factors to enhance user experience and exploration.

- The UI/UX could be further improved with better visual design and responsiveness across different devices.

Overall, the "Travel Explorer" application provides a convenient way for users to search and explore popular attractions in various travel destinations, along with associated photos. It offers an interactive and visually appealing experience for travelers to discover new places and plan their itineraries.
